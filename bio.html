              <p>Prince Wesley B. Gallardo was born on April 10, 2005. As a child, he loved playing outside with his friends. Every day was full of fun and excitement as they ran around, played games, and explored different places. He enjoyed the fresh air and the freedom of outdoor play. Playing with friends made him happy, and it was something he looked forward to every day. His childhood was filled with laughter, energy, and simple joys. However, as he grew older, his interests started to change. He no longer wanted to play outside like he used to. Instead, he found more enjoyment in staying indoors. He started spending more time on his phone, watching videos, playing games, and browsing the internet. The digital world became his new playground. He felt comfortable staying at home rather than going outside. His friendships also changed as some friends continued playing outdoors while he preferred using his phone. Even though he no longer played outside, he still found ways to enjoy his time alone. His childhood was full of fun memories, but as he grew older, his way of enjoying life changed. Over time, his interests continued to shift. He developed new hobbies that kept him engaged indoors. Watching movies, reading, and listening to music became his favorite pastimes. Although he sometimes missed playing outside, he felt content with his new routine. Change is a natural part of growing up, and he embraced the new phase of his life.</p>

              <p>During his teenage years, Gallardo became more quiet and spent less time with friends. He preferred being alone and using his phone rather than going out. This was a time when he started to see that life does not always stay the same. Some friendships faded, while new ones formed. He realized that people come and go, and not everyone stays in your life forever. These changes made him think more about life and how things happen for a reason. He learned to be more independent and to enjoy his own company. However, adjusting to these changes was not always easy. Letting go of things he was used to made him feel sad sometimes. Over time, he understood that life is always moving forward. He saw that not all things happen the way people expect them to. Despite this, he remained strong and learned to accept life's ups and downs. He realized that every experience, whether good or bad, teaches something important. His teenage years were a time of growth and learning. These years helped him become stronger and more ready for the future. He discovered new interests that kept him engaged. Reading books, listening to music, and reflecting on life became his favorite pastimes. He found comfort in expressing his thoughts through writing. This phase of his life shaped his mindset and prepared him for adulthood. Though challenges came his way, he embraced them and continued moving forward.</p>

              <p>As a college student, Gallardo describes his experience as both good and bad. College life brings many challenges, but it also offers many opportunities. There are days when everything feels easy, but there are also days when things become very difficult. He has learned that hard work is needed to succeed in college. Some subjects are difficult, and he has to study hard to understand them. There are also times when he feels unsure about what he is doing. He knows that life does not always go the way he wants it to. Some things work out, while others do not. He has experienced losing people but also meeting new ones. College has taught him to be patient and to keep moving forward. He understands that success does not happen overnight. Every mistake and challenge teaches him something new. Although college can be stressful, he believes it is an important part of life. He knows that learning never stops, and every experience helps him grow. Even though the future is uncertain, he is determined to do his best. College is a journey that is sometimes difficult, but it is also full of lessons that will help him in life. He has learned to manage his time better and balance his responsibilities. Staying motivated during tough times is not easy, but he pushes himself to keep going. No matter how hard things get, he reminds himself that perseverance will lead him to success. He believes that every struggle in college is a step towards his dreams.</p>
